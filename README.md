# Intelligent-Voice-Assistant
This project is regarding the Intelligent Voice Assistant using Python

As we know Python is a suitable language for scriptwriters and developers. Let’s write a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need. Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing.

<b><ins> Modules used : </ins></b>

-> <strong><em>pyttsx3</em></strong> : This module is used for the conversion of text to speech in a program it works offline. The pyttsx3 module supports two voices first is female and the second is male which is provided by “sapi5” for windows. 

To install this module, type the command in the terminal : pip install pyttsx3

-> <strong><em>speech_recognition</em></strong> : Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken words to text. Python supports many speech recognition engines and APIs, including Google Speech Engine, Google Cloud Speech API, Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition and IBM Speech to Text. In this tutorial we will use Google Speech Recognition Engine with Python.

-> <strong><em>datetime</em></strong> : In Python, date and time are not a data type of their own, but a module named datetime can be imported to work with the date as well as time. Python Datetime module comes built into Python, so there is no need to install it externally. 
Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times, time zones and time intervals.

-> <strong><em>wikipedia</em></strong> : Wikipedia is a Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.

-> <strong><em>webbrowser</em></strong> : In Python, webbrowser module is a convenient web browser controller. It provides a high-level interface that allows displaying Web-based documents to users. 

-> <strong><em>os</em></strong> : The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

Here's an example of how the output might look like :

Voice Assistant could be used to complete various tasks :
<ol>
  <li>Open Youtube in Browser</li>
  <li>Open google in browser</li>
  <li>Playing music</li>
  <li>Sending email using voice</li>
  <li>Acquiring time and date information using voice</li>
  <li>Gather information from Wikipedia</li>
</ol>
